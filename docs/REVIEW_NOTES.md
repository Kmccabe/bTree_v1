## Next edits proposed

- docs/README.md

## Done in this step

- Added Index and Glossary to docs/README.md; verified code fence language tags.
- Fixed intra-docs links: converted plain reference to [INTEGRITY](INTEGRITY.md) and added link to [REVIEW_NOTES](REVIEW_NOTES.md) in DATA_EXPORT.md.
- Verified anchors exist: API_REFERENCE.md#environment-variables, TROUBLESHOOTING.md#network-and-api-issues, TROUBLESHOOTING.md#getting-help.
- Left external links as-is (not in docs/): ../README.md, ../frontend/docs/*, ../tests/*.
